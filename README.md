# Chess-VBA-
A chess game I made in my free time using Visual Basic

Feel free to play around with the code by yourself or with a friend (via couch coop)
**Please note I have not yet implimented a "checkmate" feature that notifies when a player has won
**Nor have I implimented a feature that notifies you when you are in check, though illegal moves will not be possible
